# Presentational vs Container Components

Container component -> component where most of your logic and state are managed

Presentational component -> component whose sole responsiblility is to display stuff

Presentational === functional, container === class

Container Components have a render() method. Functional components do not, of course, because they themselves are functions

### Good candidates for Presentational components
Buttons
Text fields
Headers
Footers
Cards
List Items
Images
